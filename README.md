# Overview of Project

Holy Word Hunt is an app that allows the user to search for a word or phrase within the scriptures (Old Testament, New Testament, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price). The app will then tell the user how many verses that word appears in and how many total verses are in the books of scripture. The user can choose to save the search or they can continue to make new searches.

I had created a simple version of this idea in Python a year or so ago, but it was annoying to use and it would just loop through a whole text file looking for a word. I wanted a faster way to accomplish this and I wanted it to be in a format that would be easy to use so I decided to create an app.
